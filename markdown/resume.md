Education
---------

2015-2017 
:   **M.S, Electrical Engineering**; The University of Texas at Dallas (Richardson)

    GPA: 3.778 / 4.0

2011-2015
:   **B.E, Electrical and Electronics Engineering**; Anna University- Velammal Engineering College(Chennai)

    GPA: 8.512 / 10

Experience
----------

**Silicon Design Engineer, Netronome, 2018-2019**

Worked with the Network Block Interface (NBI) team, to develop, modify and debug RTL for sub-blocks such as the Traffic manager and DMA-engine. A couple of interesting tasks accomplished:

* Improved the performance of ingress DMA engine from 200 Mpps( Million packets per second) to 330 Mpps, by re-designing the buffer allocation logic.

* Removed the Packet Modifier (PM) sub-block in NBI to reduce area and power and implemented logic required for the two features(of the several features provided by PM)that the PM was being used for.

**Engineering Intern, Netronome, May 2016 - Aug 2016**

Worked on design blocks such as Island Master Bridge, Memory Unit-Cluster Local Scratch and got training to use Emulator

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages

:   **Verilog/SystemVerilog:** Advanced understanding of this popular HDL, which I use on an everyday basis at work. 

:   **python:** I frquently use python to do architectural modelling and to develop block level test benches for CDL (a HDL used in Netronome) based designs.

:   **C:** I used C frequently at University.

:   Basic knowledge of **VHDL**, **C++**, **Javascript**, **HTML**, **Java**, **TCL**, **Shell**, **SQL**, **Matlab**
