Experience

**Silicon Design Engineer, Netronome, 2018-2019**

Worked with the Network Block Interface (NBI) team, to develop, modify and debug RTL for sub-blocks such as the Traffic manager and DMA-engine. A couple of interesting tasks accomplished:

* Improved the performance of ingress DMA engine from 200 Mpps( Million packets per second) to 330 Mpps, by re-designing the buffer allocation logic.

* Removed the Packet Modifier (PM) sub-block in NBI to reduce area and power and implemented logic required for the two features(of the several features provided by PM)that the PM was being used for.

**Engineering Intern, Netronome**

Worked on design blocks such as Island Master Bridge, Memory Unit-Cluster Local Scratch and got training to use Emulator

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **Verilog/SystemVerilog:** 

:   **python:** 

:   **C:** 

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **Javascript**, **HTML**, **Java**, **TCL**, **Shell**, **SQL**,
