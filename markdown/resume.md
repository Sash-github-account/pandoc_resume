Education
---------

2015-2017 
:   **M.S, Electrical Engineering**; The University of Texas at Dallas (Richardson)

    *GPA: 3.778 / 4.0*

2011-2015
:   **B.E, Electrical and Electronics Engineering**; Anna University (Chennai)

    *GPA: 8.512 / 10*

Experience
----------

**Silicon Design Engineer, Netronome, 2018-2019**

Worked with the Network Block Interface (NBI) team, to develop, modify and debug RTL for sub-blocks such as the Traffic manager and DMA-engine. A couple of interesting tasks accomplished:

* Improved the performance of ingress DMA engine from 200 Mpps( Million packets per second) to 330 Mpps, by re-designing the buffer allocation logic.

* Removed the Packet Modifier (PM) sub-block in NBI to reduce area and power and implemented logic required for the two features(of the several features provided by PM)that the PM was being used for.

**Engineering Intern, Netronome**

Worked on design blocks such as Island Master Bridge, Memory Unit- Cluster Local Scratch and got training to use Emulator

Technical Experience
--------------------

My Cool Side Project
:   For items which don't have a clear time ordering, a definition
    list can be used to have named items.

    * These items can also contain lists, but you need to mind the
      indentation levels in the markdown source.
    * Second item.

Open Source
:   List open source contributions here, perhaps placing emphasis on
    the project names, for example the **Linux Kernel**, where you
    implemented multithreading over a long weekend, or **node.js**
    (with [link](http://nodejs.org)) which was actually totally
    your idea...

Programming Languages
:   **first-lang:** Here, we have an itemization, where we only want
    to add descriptions to the first few items, but still want to
    mention some others together at the end. A format that works well
    here is a description list where the first few items have their
    first word emphasized, and the last item contains the final few
    emphasized terms. Notice the reasonably nice page break in the pdf
    version, which wouldn't happen if we generated the pdf via html.

:   **second-lang:** Description of your experience with second-lang,
    perhaps again including a [link] [ref], this time placing the url
    reference elsewhere in the document to reduce clutter (see source
    file). 

:   **obscure-but-impressive-lang:** We both know this one's pushing
    it.

:   Basic knowledge of **C**, **x86 assembly**, **forth**, **Common Lisp**

Extra Section, Call it Whatever You Want
----------------------------------------

* Human Languages:

     * English (native speaker)
     * ???
     * This is what a nested list looks like.

* Random tidbit

* Other sort of impressive-sounding thing you did
