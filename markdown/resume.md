Education
---------

2015-2017 
:   **M.S, Electrical Engineering**; The University of Texas at Dallas (Richardson)

    GPA: 3.778 / 4.0

2011-2015
:   **B.E, Electrical and Electronics Engineering**; Anna University- Velammal Engineering College(Chennai)

    GPA: 8.512 / 10

Experience
----------

**Silicon Design Engineer, Netronome, 2018-2019**

Worked with the Network Block Interface (NBI) team, to develop, modify and debug RTL for sub-blocks such as the Traffic manager and DMA-engine. A couple of interesting tasks accomplished:

* Improved the performance of ingress DMA engine from 200 Mpps( Million packets per second) to 330 Mpps, by re-designing the buffer allocation logic.

* Removed the Packet Modifier (PM) sub-block in NBI to reduce area and power and implemented logic required for the two features(of the several features provided by PM)that the PM was being used for.

**Engineering Intern, Netronome, May 2016 - Aug 2016**

Worked on design blocks such as Island Master Bridge, Memory Unit-Cluster Local Scratch and got training to use Emulator

Technical Experience
--------------------

Academic Projects
:   Here are some of my interesting academic projects.

    * Mini Stereo Digital Audio Processor - a complete ASIC design project with RTL coding, SV testbench and APR.
    
    * Trivium Cipher physical design with custom library using Cadence Virtuoso.
    
    * Low Noise Amplifier - a low noise amplifier operating at 2.4 to 2.5 GHz, 1.2 V, with a transducer gain of 13.9 dB.

Programming Languages

:   **Verilog/SystemVerilog:** Advanced understanding of this popular HDL, which I use on an everyday basis at work. 

:   **python:** I frequently use python to do architectural modelling and to develop block level test benches for RTL.

:   **C:** I used C frequently at University.

:   Basic knowledge of **VHDL**, **C++**, **Javascript**, **HTML**, **Java**, **TCL**, **Shell**, **SQL**, **Matlab**
